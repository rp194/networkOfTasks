This project, titled ”Model Checking for Task Networks of Real-Time and Autonomous
Systems,” explores and analyzes task models in real-time and autonomous systems. The
primary objective of this research is to provide an effective method for model checking
in these types of systems to ensure the accuracy and correctness of their performance under
various conditions. In today’s world, autonomous devices such as robots, drones, and
self-driving vehicles are becoming key components of everyday life and industry. These
systems must operate under strict time constraints due to the need for fast and precise data
processing and timely responses to environmental changes. One of the main challenges in
designing and implementing these systems is ensuring their correct and timely operation.
Any defect or delay in their response could lead to unfortunate incidents and decrease their
reliability. In this research, model checking techniques are employed to analyze and examine
real-time and autonomous systems. Model checking allows us to identify and address
potential weaknesses and limitations by precisely and comprehensively modeling the activities
and interactions within the system. This method examines the accuracy and timing
of activities by generating a state space for the system and analyzing it, ensuring the system
functions correctly under all conditions. The steps in this research include generating
the state space for different time units, analyzing the state space to find optimal execution
paths for activities, and reducing the state space to optimize computational resources.
The results of this study indicate that using model checking can significantly enhance the
reliability and efficiency of real-time and autonomous systems, reducing the likelihood
of errors and inefficiencies. This practical and fundamental research contributes to the
existing knowledge in the field of real-time and autonomous systems and can serve as a
reference for future studies in this area. Additionally, this research can help improve the
design and implementation of autonomous systems in various industries and domains.
